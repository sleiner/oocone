`oocone.Enocoo.get_individual_consumption()` with `interval == "year"` used to return `Consumption` objects where the start was a [datetime.date](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects).
Now, it returns [datetime.datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects), as promised by the type hints.
