We made `Enocoo.get_meter_table` more flexible:

-   You can now pass in a date for which the latest meter table shall be returned.
-   If no data is available yet for the meter table page of the given day, we try looking at the meter table page for the previous day.
    If that contains data for the given day at 00:00, we return that data.
    Additionally, you may set a time until which data from the previous day are still acceptable.
    This is helpful, because data from the Enocoo website may lag behind up until 30 minutes in regular operation.
    So, shortly after midnight, the newest data available might be from 23:45.
    If you set the `allow_previous_day_until` parameter to `datetime.time(23, 45)`, you will get those data shortly after midnight.
